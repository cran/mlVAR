Changes in version 0.4.1
  o mlVAR now uses correlations of residuals as estimate for the contemporaneous correlation matrix (not partial) if estimated inverse covariance matrix is not properly invetable
  o Added mlVARsample function to run a simulation study 
given a mlVAR object.
  o Fixed a bug with estimator = "mPlus"
  o mlVAR now gives a warning when between-subject networks could not be computed, rather than breaking with an uninformative error.

Changes in version 0.4
  o Added AR argument to mlVAR to fit AR models only
  o estimator = "Mplus" is now supported! Requires Mplus 8 to be installed.
    o Several arguments have been added to mlVAR to handle Mplus estimation

Changes in version 0.3.3
  o The plot method for mlVAR sim objects now uses nonsig = "show"
  o plot method now uses nonsig = "show" by default!
  o Summary method now shows p-values for contemporaneous effects
  o Several small bugfixes

Changes in version 0.3.1
  o The 'partial' argument in 'plot.mlVAR' now defaults to TRUE
  o Added 'contemporaneous' argument to mlVAR
  o Added 'lm' estimator for fitting unique VAR models per subject
  o Added 'rule' argument to plot.mlVAR to set the rule of choosing significance in nodewise GGM estimation

Changes in version 0.3
  o Complete rework of package! 
    o mlVAR, mlVARsim, and relevant methods have been completely rewritten
    o Now support contemporaneous effects and between-subjects effects
    o Old functions are now labeled mlVAR0, mlVARsim0, etcetera
