Changes in Version 0.5.1
  - Fixed remaining deprecated dplyr functions

Changes in Version 0.5
  - The 'mlVARsample' function has been added to mlVAR
  - Added Myrthe Veenman to contributor list
  - Fixed a bug where contemporaneous standard deviations were reported as variances instead of standard deviations
  - Fixed a bug with the beepvar argument
  - Replaced deprecated dplyr functions
  - Added a warning for when a beep is used multiple times
  - The 'nonsig' argument in the plot method now defaults to 'show' when SD=TRUE
  - Fixed a bug in the summary method when fixed effects estimation was used

Changes in version 0.4.3
  o mlVAR now issues a warning when < 20 observations per subject are used
  o Fixed a bug with 'lmerResults2'
  o Now suppressing warnings and messages from lmer
  o Added a progress bar for computing random effects

Changes in version 0.4.2
  o Contemporaneous multi-level models are now returned in the output

Changes in version 0.4.1
  o mlVAR now uses correlations of residuals as estimate for the contemporaneous correlation matrix (not partial) if estimated inverse covariance matrix is not properly invetable
  o Added mlVARsample function to run a simulation study 
given a mlVAR object.
  o Fixed a bug with estimator = "mPlus"
  o mlVAR now gives a warning when between-subject networks could not be computed, rather than breaking with an uninformative error.

Changes in version 0.4
  o Added AR argument to mlVAR to fit AR models only
  o estimator = "Mplus" is now supported! Requires Mplus 8 to be installed.
    o Several arguments have been added to mlVAR to handle Mplus estimation

Changes in version 0.3.3
  o The plot method for mlVAR sim objects now uses nonsig = "show"
  o plot method now uses nonsig = "show" by default!
  o Summary method now shows p-values for contemporaneous effects
  o Several small bugfixes

Changes in version 0.3.1
  o The 'partial' argument in 'plot.mlVAR' now defaults to TRUE
  o Added 'contemporaneous' argument to mlVAR
  o Added 'lm' estimator for fitting unique VAR models per subject
  o Added 'rule' argument to plot.mlVAR to set the rule of choosing significance in nodewise GGM estimation

Changes in version 0.3
  o Complete rework of package! 
    o mlVAR, mlVARsim, and relevant methods have been completely rewritten
    o Now support contemporaneous effects and between-subjects effects
    o Old functions are now labeled mlVAR0, mlVARsim0, etcetera
